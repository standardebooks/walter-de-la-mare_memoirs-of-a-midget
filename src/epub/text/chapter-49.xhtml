			<p>When next Fanny and I met, it was in the cool grey-green summery drawing-room at Monk’s House, and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Monnerie and Susan shared tea with us. One covert glance at <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Monnerie’s face had reassured me. That strange mask was as vigilant and secretive, but as serene, as when it had first smiled on me in the mauves and gildings of Brunswick House. She had set her world right again and was at peace with mankind. As complacently as ever she stretched me out her finger. She had not even taken the trouble to forgive me for my little “scene”; had let it perish of its own insignificance. Oh, I thought, if I could be as life-size as that! I did not learn till many days afterwards, however, that she had had news of me from France. <em>Good</em> news, which Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr>, trusting in my patience and common-sense, had kept back from me until he could deliver it in person and we could enjoy it together.</p>
			<p>Only one topic of conversation was ours that afternoon⁠—that “amazing Prodigy of Nature,” the Spanish Princess; <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Monnerie’s one regret that she herself had not discovered a star of such ineffably minute magnitude. Yet her teasing and sarcasm were so nimble and good-humoured; she insinuated so pleasantly her little drolleries and innuendoes; that even if Miss <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">M.</abbr> had had true cause for envy and malice, she could have taken no offence. Far from it.</p>
			<p>I looked out of the long open windows at the dipping, flittering wagtails on the lawn; shrugged my shoulders; made little mouths at her with every appearance of wounded vanity. Did she really think, I inquired earnestly, that that shameless creature was as lovely as the showman’s bills made her out to be? Mightn’t it all be a cheat, a trick? Didn’t they always exaggerate⁠—just to make money? The more jovially she enjoyed my discomfiture, nodding her head, swaying in her chair, the more I enjoyed my duplicity. The real danger was that I should be a little too clever, overact my part, and arouse her suspicions.</p>
			<p>“Ah, you little know, you little know,” I muttered to myself, sharply conscious the while of the still, threatening presence of Fanny. But she meant to let me go⁠—that was enough. It was to be good riddance to bad rubbish. There was nothing to fear from her⁠—yet. Her eyes lightly dwelling on me over her Chelsea teacup, she sat drinking us in. Well, she should never taunt me with not having played up to her conception of me.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>“Well, well,” <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Monnerie concluded, “all it means, my dear, is that you are not quite such a rarity as we supposed. Who is? There’s nothing unique in this old world; though character, even bad character, never fails to make its mark. Ask <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pellew.”</p>
			<p>“But, surely, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Monnerie,” said I, “it isn’t character to sell yourself at twopence a look.”</p>
			<p>“Mere scruples, Poppet,” she retorted. “Think of it. If only you could have pocketed that pretty little fastidiousness of yours, the newspapers would now be ringing with your fame. And the fortune! You are too pernickety. Aren’t we all of us on show? And aren’t nine out of ten of us striving to be more on show than we are entitled to be? If man’s first disobedience and the rest of it doesn’t mean that, then what, I ask you, Mademoiselle <i xml:lang="fr">Bas Bleu</i>, was the sour old Puritan so concerned about? Assist me, Susan, if I stumble.”</p>
			<p>“I wish I could, Aunt Alice,” said Susan sweetly, cutting the cake. “You must ask Miss Bowater.”</p>
			<p>“<em>Please</em>, Miss Monnerie,” drawled Fanny.</p>
			<p>“Whether or not,” said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Monnerie crisply, “I beseech you, children, don’t quarrel about it. There is our beloved Sovereign on her throne; and there the last innocent little victim in its cradle; and there’s the old sun waggishly illuminating the whole creaking stage. Blind beggar and dog, Toby, artists, authors, parsons, statesmen⁠—heart and everything else, or everything else but heart, on sleeve⁠—and all on show⁠—every one of them⁠—at <em>something</em> a look. No, my dear, there’s only one private life, the next: and, according to some accounts, that will be more public than ever. And so twirls the Merry-go-Round.”</p>
			<p>Her voice relapsed, as it were, into herself again, and she drew in her lips. She looked about her as if in faint surprise; and in returning to its usual expression, it seemed to me that her countenance had paused an instant in an exceedingly melancholy condition. Perhaps she had caught the glint of sympathy in my eye.</p>
			<p>“But isn’t that all choice, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Monnerie?” I leaned forward to ask. “And aren’t some people what one might call conspicuous, simply because they are really and truly, as it were, superior to other people? I don’t mean better⁠—just superior.”</p>
			<p>“I <em>think</em>, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Monnerie,” murmured Fanny deprecatingly, “she’s referring to that ‘<i xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i>’ jingle⁠—about the fleas, you know. Or was it <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Watts, Midgetina?”</p>
			<p>“Never mind about <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Watts,” said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Monnerie flatly. “The point from which we have strayed, my dear, is that even if you were not born great, you were born exquisite; and now here’s this Angélique rigmarole⁠—” Her face creased up into its old good-humoured facetiousness: “Was it three inches, Miss Bowater?”</p>
			<p>“Four, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Monnerie,” lipped Fanny suavely.</p>
			<p>“Four! pooh! Still, that’s what they say; half a head or more, my dear, more exquisite! Perfect nonsense, of course. It’s physically impossible. These Radical newspapers! And the absinthe, too.” Her small black-brown eyes roamed round a little emptily. Absinthe! was that a Fanny story? “But there, my child,” she added easily, “you shall see for yourself. We dine with the Padgwick-Steggals; and then go on together. So that’s settled. It will be my first travelling circus since I was a child. Most amusing: if the lion doesn’t get out, and there’s none of those horrible accidents on the trapeze one goes in hope to see. By the way, Miss Bowater, your letter was posted?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, yes, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Monnerie⁠—this afternoon; but, as you know, I was a little doubtful about the address.” She hastened to pass me a plate of button-sized ratafias; and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Monnerie slowly turned a smiling but not quite ingenuous face aside.</p>
			<p>“What a curious experience the circus will be for you, Midgetina,” Fanny was murmuring softly, glancing back over her shoulder towards the tea-table. “Personally, I believe the Signorina Angélique and the rest of it is only one of those horrible twisted up prodigies with all the bones out of place. Mightn’t it, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Monnerie, be a sort of shock, you know, for Miss <abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:given-name">M.</abbr>? She’s still a little pale and peaky.”</p>
			<p>“She shall come, I say, and see for herself,” replied <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Monnerie petulantly.</p>
			<p>There was a pause. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Monnerie gazed vacantly at the tiers of hothouse flowers that decorated the window-recess. Susan sat with a little forked frown between her brows. She never seemed to derive the least enjoyment from this amiable, harmless midget-baiting. Not at any rate one hundredth part as much as I did. Fanny set Plum begging for yet another ratafia. And then, after a long, deep breath, my skin all “gooseflesh,” I looked straight across at my old friend.</p>
			<p>“I don’t think, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Monnerie,” I said, “if you don’t mind⁠—I don’t think I really <em>wish</em> to go.”</p>
			<p>As if Joshua had spoken, the world stood still.</p>
			<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Monnerie slowly turned her head. “Another headache?”</p>
			<p>“No, I’m perfectly well, thank you. But, whatever I may have said, I don’t approve of that poor creature showing herself for⁠—for money. She is selling herself. It <em>must</em> be because there’s no other way out.”</p>
			<p>Finger and thumb outstretched above the cringing little dog, Fanny was steadily watching me. With a jerk of my whole body I turned on her. “You agreed with me, Fanny, didn’t you, in the garden yesterday afternoon?”</p>
			<p>Placidly drooped her lids: “Trust, Plum, trust!”</p>
			<p>“What!” croaked <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Monnerie, “you, Miss Bowater! Guilty of that silly punctilio! She was merely humouring you, child. It will be a most valuable experience. You shall be perfectly protected. Pride, eh? Or is it jealousy? Now what would you say if I promise to try and ransom the poor creature?⁠—buy her out? pension her off? Would <em>that</em> be a nice charitable little thing to do? She might make you quite a pleasant companion.”</p>
			<p>“Ah, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Monnerie, please let <em>me</em> buy her out. Let me be the intermediary!” I found myself, hands clasped in lap, yearningly stooping towards her, just like a passionate young lady in a novel.</p>
			<p>She replied ominously, knitting her thick, dark eyebrows. “And how’s that to be done, pray, if you sulk here at home?”</p>
			<p>“I think, Aunt Alice, it’s an excellent plan,” cried Susan, “much, much more considerate. She could write. Think of all those horrible people! The poor thing may have been kidnapped, forced to do her silly tricks like one of those wretched, little barbered-up French poodles. Anyhow, I don’t suppose she’s there⁠—or anywhere else, for that matter⁠—for <em>fun</em>!”</p>
			<p>Even Susan’s sympathy had its sting.</p>
			<p>“Thank you, Susan,” was <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Monnerie’s acid retort. “<em>Your</em> delicate soul can always be counted on. But advice, my child, is much the more valuable when asked for.”</p>
			<p>“Of course I mustn’t interfere, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Monnerie,” interposed Fanny sweetly; “but wouldn’t it perhaps be as well for you to see the poor thing first? She mayn’t be quite⁠—quite a proper kind of person, may she? At least that’s what the newspapers seem to suggest. Not, of course, that Miss <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">M.</abbr> wouldn’t soon teach her better manners.”</p>
			<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Monnerie’s head wagged gently in time to her shoe. “H’m. There’s something in that, Miss Worldly-Wise. Reports don’t seem to flatter her. But still, I like my own way best. Poppet must <em>come and see</em>. After all, she should be the better judge.”</p>
			<p>Never before had <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Monnerie so closely resembled a puffed-out tawny owl.</p>
			<p>I looked at her fixedly: shook my head. “No: no judge,” I spluttered. “I’m sorry, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Monnerie, but I <em>won’t</em> go.”</p>
			<p>There was no misdoubting her anger now. The brows forked. The loose-skinned hands twitched. She lifted herself in her chair. “<em>Won’t</em>,” she said. “You vex me, child. And pray don’t wriggle at me in that hysterical fashion. You are beside yourself; trembling like a mouse. You have been mooning alone too much, I can see. Run away and nurse that silly head, and at the same time thank heaven that you have more time and less need of the luxury than someone else we know of. It may be a low life, but it needs courage. I’ll say <em>that</em> for her.”</p>
			<p>She swept her hands to her knees over her silken lap, and turned upon Susan.</p>
