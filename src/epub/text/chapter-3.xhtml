			<p>Not that in an existence so passive riddles never came my way. As one morning I brushed past a bush of lads’ love (or maidens’ ruin, as some call it), its fragrance sweeping me from top to toe, I stumbled on the carcass of a young mole. Curiosity vanquished the first gulp of horror. Holding my breath, with a stick I slowly edged it up in the dust and surveyed the white heaving nest of maggots in its belly with a peculiar and absorbed recognition. “Ah, ha!” a voice cried within me, “so this is what is in wait; this is how things are”; and I stooped with lips drawn back over my teeth to examine the stinking mystery more closely. That was a lesson I have never unlearned.</p>
			<p>One of a rather different kind had another effect. I was sitting in the garden one day watching in the distance a jay huffling and sidling and preening its feathers on a bit of decrepit fencing. Suddenly there fell a sharp crack of sound. In a flash, with a derisive chattering, the jay was flown: and then I saw Adam Waggett, half doubled up, stealing along towards the place. I lay in wait for him. With catapult dangling in one hand, the other fist tight shut, he came along like a thief. And I cried hollowly out of my concealment, “Adam, what have you there?”</p>
			<p>Such a picture of foolish shame I have never seen. He was compelled none the less to exhibit his spoil, an eye-shut, twinkle-tailed, needle-billed Jenny Wren crumpled up in his great, dirty paw. Fury burnt up in me like a fire. What I said to him I cannot remember, but it was nothing sweet; and it was a cowed Adam Waggett that loafed off as truculently as he could towards the house, his catapult and victim left behind him. But that was his lesson rather than mine, and one which <em>he</em> never forgot.</p>
			<p>When in my serener moods Pollie’s voice would be heard slyly hallooing for me, I would rouse up with a shock to realize again the little cell of my body into which I had been confined. Then she and I would eat our luncheon, a few snippets of biscuit, a cherry or two, or slice of apple for me, and for her a hunch of bread and bacon about half my size in length and thickness. I would turn my back on her, for I could not endure to see her gobble her meal, having an abhorrence of cooked flesh, and a dainty stomach. Still, like most children I could be greedy, and curious of unfamiliar foods. To a few forbidden black currants which I reached up and plucked from their rank-smelling bush, and devoured, skin and all, I owe lesson Number 3. This one, however, had to be repeated.</p>
			<p>Childhood quickly fleets away. Those happy, unhappy, faraway days seem like mere glimpses of a dragonfly shimmering and darting over my garden stream, though at the actual time they more closely resembled, perhaps, a continuous dream broken into bits of vivid awakening.</p>
			<p>As I grew older, my skirts grew longer, my desire for independence sharper, and my wits more inquiring. On my seventeenth birthday I put up my hair, and was confirmed by a bishop whom my godmother persuaded to officiate in the house. It was a solemn occasion; but my mother was a good deal concerned about the lunch, and I with the ballooning lawn sleeves and the two square episcopal fingertips disposed upon my head. The experience cast a peaceful light into my mind and shook my heart, but it made me for a time a little self-conscious of both my virtue and my sins. I began to brood not only on the deplorable state of my own soul, but also on Pollie’s and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ballard’s, and became for a time a diminutive Miss Fenne. I suppose innocence is a precarious bliss. On the other hand, if one’s mind is like a dead mole’s belly, it is wise, I think, to examine it closely but not too often, and to repeat that confirmation for one’s self every morning and evening.</p>
			<p>As a young child I had been, of course, as naturally religious as a savage or an angel. But even then, I think, I never could quite believe that Paradise was a mere Fenne-land.</p>
			<p>Once I remember in the midst of my multiplication table I had broken out unannounced with, “Then <em>God</em> made the world, mamma?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, my dear.”</p>
			<p>“And all things in the forests and the birds in the sky and⁠—and moles, and this?” I held down my limp, coral-coloured arithmetic.</p>
			<p>“Yes,” said she.</p>
			<p>I wondered a while, losing myself, as if in wanderings like Ariel’s, between the clouds. “What, mamma, did He make them of?” my voice interrupted me.</p>
			<p>“He made them,” said my mother steadily, “of His Power and Love.”</p>
			<p>Rapidly I slid back into her company. “And can we, can I, make things of <em>my</em> power and love?”</p>
			<p>“I suppose, my dear,” replied my mother reflectively and perhaps thinking of my father in his study, over his Paper and Hops, “it is only <em>that</em> in life that is really worth doing.”</p>
			<p>“Then,” I said sagely, “I <em>suspects</em> that’s how Mullings does the garden, mamma.”</p>
			<p>Long before Miss Fenne’s and the bishop’s visitation my mother had set about teaching me in earnest. A governess⁠—a Miss Perry⁠—was our first experiment. Alas, apart from her tendency to quinsy, it was I who was found wanting. She complained of the strain on her nerves. My mother feared that quinsy was catching; and Miss Perry had no successor. Reading was always a difficulty. My father bought me as tiny old books as could be found, including a dwarf Bible, a midget Pickering Shakespeare, and a grammar (with a menagerie for frontispiece) from which I learned that “irony is a figure which intends the reverse of what it speaks, and under the masque of praise, conceals the most biting satyr”; and the following stanza:⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
				<p>
					<span>Hail Energeia! hail my native tongue</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Concisely full, and musically strong;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou with the pencil hold’st a glorious strife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And paint’st the passions equal to the life.</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>My mother agreed that <em>strung</em> would be preferable to “<em>strong</em>,” and explained that “the passions” did not signify merely ill-temper; while, if I pecked over-nicely at my food, my father would cry “Hail Energeia!” a challenge which rarely failed to persuade me to set to.</p>
			<p>My grandfather sent me other pygmy books from Paris, including a minute masterpiece of calligraphy, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="fr">Une Anthologie de Chansons pour une Minuscule Aimante et Bien-aimée par <abbr>P.</abbr> de <abbr class="eoc">R.</abbr></i> These I could easily carry about with me. I soon learned to accustom my arms and shoulders to bulkier and more cumbrous volumes. My usual method with a common-sized book was to prop it up towards the middle of the table and then to seat myself at the edge. The page finished, I would walk across and turn over a fresh leaf. Thus in my solitude I studied my lessons and read again and again my nursery favourites, some of them, I gather, now undeservedly out of fashion.</p>
			<p>Perhaps even better than fiction or folktales, I liked books of knowledge.</p>
			<p>There were two of these in particular, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Observing Eye; or Lessons to Children on the Three Lowest Divisions of Animal Life⁠—The Radiated, Articulated, and Molluscous</i>, and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Childhood of the World</i>. Even at nine I remarked how nimbly the anonymous author of the former could skip from <abbr>St.</abbr> Paul to the lobster; and I never wearied of brooding on <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Clodd’s frontispiece. This depicts a large-headed and seemingly one-legged little girl in a flounced frock lying asleep under a wall on which ivy is sprawling. For pillow for herself and her staring doll there lies on the ground a full-sized human skull, and in the middle distance are seen the monoliths of Stonehenge. Beyond these gigantic stones, and behind the far mountains, rises with spiky rays an enormous Sun.</p>
			<p><em>I</em> was that child; and mine her sun that burned in heaven, and he a more obedient luminary than any lamp of man’s. I would wonder what she would do when she awoke from sleep. The skull, in particular, both terrified and entranced me⁠—the secret of all history seemed to lie hidden in the shadows beneath its dome. Indeed I needed no reminder from <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Clodd that “Children (and some grown-up people too) are apt to think that things are wonderful only when they are big, which is not true.”</p>
			<p>I knew already, out of nowhere, that “the bee’s waxen cell is more curious than the chimpanzee’s rough hut” (though I should have dearly liked to see the latter); and that “an ant is more wonderful than the huge and dull rhinoceros.” Such is childishness, however: I pitied the poor rhinoceros his “dull.” Over such small things as a nut, a shell, a drop of rainwater in a buttercup, a frond of frost (for there were cold winters at Lyndsey in those days), I would pore and pore, imbibing the lesson that the eye alone if used in patience will tell its owner far more about an object than it can merely see.</p>
			<p>Among my few framed pictures I cannot resist mentioning one by a painter of the name of Bosch. Below the middle of it kneeled naked Adam and Eve with exquisite crimped hair on their shoulders; and between them stood God. All above and beneath them, roamed the animals, birds, insects, and infinitesimals of Eden, including a long-tailed monkey on an elephant, a jerboa, a dancing crocodile, and⁠—who but our cat Miaou, carrying off a mouse! An astonishing, inexhaustible piece of thoughtfulness. I loved Mynheer Bosch.</p>
			<p>Shameful dunce Miss <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">M.</abbr> may remain, but she did in her childhood supremely enjoy any simple book about the things of creation great or small. But I preferred my own notions of some of them. When my father of a dark, clear night would perch me up at a window to see the stars⁠—Charles’s Wain and the Chair; and told me that they were huge boiling suns, roaring their way through the vast pits of space, I would shake my head to myself. I was grateful for the science, but preferred to keep them just “stars.” And though I loved to lave my hands in a trickle of light that had been numberless years on its journey to this earth, that of a candle also filled me with admiration, and I was unfeignedly grieved that the bleak moon was naught but a sheer hulk, sans even air or ice or rain or snow.</p>
			<p>How much pleasanter it would be to think that her shine was the reflection of our cherry orchards, and that her shadows were just Kentish hayricks, barns, and oast-houses. It was, too, perhaps rather tactless of my father to beguile me with full-grown authors’ accounts of the Lives of the Little. Accomplished writers they may be, but⁠—well, never mind. As for the Lives of the Great, I could easily adjust Monsieur Bon Papa’s spyglass and reduce them to scale.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>My father taught me also to swim in his round bath; and on a visit to Canterbury purchased for me the nimblest little dun Shetland pony, whom we called Mopsa. I learned to become a fearless rider. But hardy though her race may be, perhaps I was too light a burden to satisfy Mopsa’s spirit. In a passing fit of temper she broke a leg. Though I had stopped my ears for an hour before the Vet came, I heard the shot.</p>
			<p>My mother’s lessons were never very burdensome. She taught me little, but she taught it well⁠—even a morsel of Latin. I never wearied of the sweet oboe-like nasal sound of her French poems, and she instilled in me such a delight in words that to this day I firmly believe that things are at least twice the better and richer for being called by them. Apart from a kind of passionate impatience over what was alien to me⁠—arithmetic, for instance, and “analysis”⁠—and occasional fits of the sulks, which she allowed to deposit their own sediment at leisure, I was a willing, and, at times, even a greedy scholar. Apparently from infancy I was of a firm resolve to match my wits with those of the common-sized and to be “grown-up” some day.</p>
			<p>So much for my education, a thing which it seems to me is likely to continue⁠—and specially in respect of human nature⁠—as long as I keep alive. With so little childish company, without rivalry, I was inclined to swell myself out with conceit and complacency. “It’s easy holding down the latchet when nobody pulls the string.” But whatever size we may be, in soul or body, I have found that the world wields a sharp pin, and is pitiless to bubbles.</p>
			<p>Though inclined to be dreamy and idle when alone, I was, of course, my own teacher too. My senses were seven in number, however few my wits. In particular I loved to observe the clustering and gathering of plants, like families, each of a shape, size, and hue, each in their kind and season, though tall and lowly were intermingled. Now and then I would come on some small plant self-sown, shining and flourishing, free and clear, and even the lovelier for being alone in its kind amid its greater neighbours. I prized these discoveries, and if any one of them was dwarfed a little by its surroundings I would cosset it up and help it against them. How strange, thought I, if men so regarded each other’s intelligence. If from pitying the dull-witted the sharp-witted slid to mere toleration, and from toleration to despising and loathing. What a contest would presently begin between the strong-bodied stupid and the feeble-bodied clever, and how soon there would be no strong-bodied stupid left in the world! They would dwindle away and disappear into Time like the mammoth and the woolly bear. And then I began to be sorry for the woolly bear and to wish I could go and have a look at him. Perhaps this is putting my old head on those young shoulders, but when I strive to re-enter the thoughts of those remote days, how like they seem to the noisy wasting stream beside which they flowed on, and of whose source and destination I was unaware.</p>
			<p>All this egotism recalls a remark that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ballard once made apropos of some little smart repartee from Miss <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">M.</abbr> as she sat beside her pasteboard and slapped away at a lump of dough, “Well <em>I</em> know a young lady who’s been talking to the young man that rubbed his face with a brass candlestick.”</p>
